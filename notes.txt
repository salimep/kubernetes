Create your first key:


openssl genrsa -out test-ingress-1.key 2048
Create your first certificate signing request:


openssl req -new -key test-ingress-1.key -out test-ingress-1.csr \
    -subj "/CN=FIRST_DOMAIN"
Replace FIRST_DOMAIN with a domain name that you own.

For example, suppose you want the load balancer to serve requests from the example.com domain. Your certificate signing request would look like this:


openssl req -new -key test-ingress-1.key -out test-ingress-1.csr \
    -subj "/CN=example.com"
Create your first certificate:


openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in test-ingress-1.csr -signkey test-ingress-1.key \
    -out test-ingress-1.crt
Create your second key:


openssl genrsa -out test-ingress-2.key 2048
Create your second certificate signing request:


openssl req -new -key test-ingress-2.key -out test-ingress-2.csr \
    -subj "/CN=SECOND_DOMAIN"
Replace SECOND_DOMAIN with another domain name that you own.

For example, suppose you want the load balancer to serve requests from the examplepetstore.com domain. Your certificate signing request would look like this:


openssl req -new -key test-ingress-2.key -out test-ingress-2.csr \
    -subj "/CN=examplepetstore.com"
Create your second certificate:


openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in test-ingress-2.csr -signkey test-ingress-2.key \
    -out test-ingress-2.crt
